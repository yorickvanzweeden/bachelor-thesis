# Bachelor thesis
This repository contains all code, models and other files related to my bachelor thesis. The thesis is about the documentation of Android app architecture and can be found [here](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/blob/master/Bachelor%20Thesis%20-%20Yorick%20van%20Zweeden:%20Towards%20architecture%20documentation%20for%20Android%20apps.pdf). If you are going to print it, print it in color.

Using the design science research method, we have developed a set of views that describe the architecture of Android apps. It is showcased using a demo application called [HelloWorld](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/HelloWorld). The corresponding views can be viewed [here](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/Hello%20World%20-%20Models). They have a transparent background, so downloading them may be a good idea. We demonstrate the feasibility using two case studies. The first case study is the [K-9 Mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9) app and the second study is the [OmniNotes](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes) app. The created views can be found [here](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/K-9%20Mail%20-%20Models) and respectively [here](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/OmniNotes%20-%20Models).

If you want to create architecture documentation yourself, you are advised to read my thesis. In section 5.4, a procedure is described. I have used [draw.io](draw.io) as modelling software. You can import the symbols as scratchpad with [the scratchpad export](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/blob/master/drawio-scratchpad.xml). Additionally, you may want to use the [Python script](https://github.com/yorickvanzweeden/bachelor-thesis/tree/master/Scripts) as described in the procedure. They require Python3 and the installation of the packages (xml, csv, os, re, subproces, threading, enum, graphviz). Most of the packages will have been installed with the installation of Python. Errors on execution will lead the way ;)
